// 1. Create a variable called sentence.The value of the variable should be a string that contains the words“ not” and“ bad”.For example, “The movie is not that bad, I like it”.

// var.sentence = "The movie is not that bad, I like it"


// 2. Create a variable called wordNot where it’ s value is the first appearance of the substring“ not”(from the sentence variable).

// var.wordNot = "not that bad, I like it"


// 3. Create a variable called wordBad where it’ s value is the first appearance of the substring“ bad”(from the sentence variable).


// var.wordBad = "bad, I like it"

// 4. If the word“ bad” comes after the word“ not”, you should replace the whole“ not… bad” substring with“ good”, then console.log the result.



// var sentence = "The movie is not that bad, I like it"
// var sentence = sentence.replace(/not that bad/, "good");
// console.log(sentence)

// var wordNot = "not that bad, I like it"
// var wordNot = wordNot.replace(/not that bad/, "good");
// console.log(wordNot)


var wordBad = "bad, I like it"
console.log(wordBad)
