    <h1>The lions</h1>
    <hr>
    <div>
        <p>Present in Africa and India, the lion typically inhabits grasslands and savannahs, but is absent in dense forests.
            <br> It is usually more diurnal than other big cats, but when persecuted adapts to being active at night and at
            <br> twilight. A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females and cubs. Prides vary in size and
            <br> composition from three to 20 adult lions, depending on habitat and prey availability. Females cooperate when
            <br> hunting and prey mostly on large ungulates, including antelope, deer, buffalo, zebra and even giraffes</p>
